<p>The CCPA permits requests to know from the same consumer up to twice in a twelve (12) month period.</p>
<p>Unless you have previously contacted us and/or provided us with identifying information (ex: your full name, email address, physical address, and/or telephone number), we are generally unable to respond to requests to know.</p>

If we are unable to verify your request, we will notify you as well.</p>
<p><em>Your Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights</em></p>
<p>California affords consumers with the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by a business for the exercise of their privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. This means that you cannot be denied goods or services; be charged different prices or rates; be provided with a different level or quality of goods or services; or have it suggested that you will receive a different price or rate or different level or quality of goods or services. Notwithstanding the above, a business can charge a consumer a different rate or price, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data. Further, notwithstanding the above, a business may offer financial incentives for the collection of personal information, the sale of personal information, or the deletion of personal information, and may also offer a different price, rate, level, or quality of goods or services to the consumer if that different is directly related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data.</p>
